                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I'm a Hardware Engineer at Apple, where I contribute to cutting-edge RF IC and silicon photonics systems. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University in April 2024, specializing in RF integrated circuit design and silicon photonics with a focus on intelligent control systems for next-generation communication and sensing platforms.</p>
                <p>My approach bridges analog circuit design, photonic system architecture, and machine learning—creating adaptive hardware that optimizes itself in real-time. From chip tape-outs to system-level innovation, I work at the intersection where electronics meets photonics and intelligence.</p>

                <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
                <p>My career spans both academic research and industry leadership roles at some of the world's most innovative technology companies. At <strong>Apple</strong>, I engineer advanced hardware systems that push the boundaries of what's possible in RF IC and silicon photonics integration.</p>
                <p>Prior to Apple, I contributed to groundbreaking technology development at <strong>Meta Reality Labs</strong>, where I developed laser and MEMS driver ICs with automatic stabilization loops for photonic display systems used in AR/VR headsets. At <strong>Qualcomm</strong> and the <strong>Fraunhofer Institute</strong>, I designed high-speed optical receivers and energy-efficient RF transmitters that push the boundaries of performance and power efficiency.</p>
                <p>This unique combination of academic depth and industry impact enables me to deliver solutions that are both theoretically sound and practically transformative.</p>
