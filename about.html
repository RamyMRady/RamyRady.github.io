                <h2>Journey from Research to Industry</h2>
                <p>Ramy's career spans cutting-edge research and industry innovation. During his PhD, he developed AI control systems and GenAI-assisted engineering methods for silicon photonic filters, achieving up to 10× faster tuning speeds and >40dB jammer rejection. His work bridged the gap between theoretical research and practical hardware implementation, resulting in 8+ peer-reviewed publications in top-tier journals and conferences.</p>
                <p>Before joining Apple, Ramy contributed to breakthrough hardware projects at Meta Reality Labs (AR/VR photonic drivers), Qualcomm (5G RF ICs), and Fraunhofer Institute (high-speed optical receivers, microwave photonics). These experiences shaped his ability to design complex hardware systems that meet demanding performance, power, and reliability requirements.</p>
